- Spinning wheel in the back (or just on the cart)
- Window showing that it's snowing outside
- Drawn assets (including transforming present due to jankiness)
- Website Design should change based on Holiday
    - April Fools= Destroyed facilty but then to be shown that it's a recording
    - New Years = Elves have the day off
    - Halloween
    - St Patricks Day?
    - Christmas

## Developer Notes:
- Check for resizing adjuments with all the elements by applying position absolute and their vertical positioning
- Fix fallingpresent issues with resizing
      - Box peeks out early
-Fallingpresents sometimes freezes mid air so timing can be improved
